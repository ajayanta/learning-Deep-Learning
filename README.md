# Deep Learning Projects and Notes

This repository documents my journey of deep learning. It includes a collection of hands-on projects, theoretical notes, and code implementations using Python and libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of deep learning
- Build and train neural networks from scratch and using libraries
- Work on practical problems involving image and text data
- Document and track progress through structured folders and notes

## Contents

- `Perceptron_Basics/` – Implementation of perceptron, activation functions, and logic gates
- `Neural_Networks/` – Feedforward neural networks, backpropagation, and training routines
- `CNN/` – Convolutional Neural Networks for image data
- `RNN_LSTM/` – Recurrent models for sequence data
- `NLP/` – Text data preprocessing and classification models
- `Transformers/` – Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms
- `GANs/` – Generative models and experiments
- `Notes/` – Summary notes, formulas, and key concepts

## Tools and Technologies
